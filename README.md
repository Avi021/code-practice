# Questions

## Find the Number Occurring Odd Number of Times
> Given an array of positive integers. All numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find the number in O(n) time & constant space.
 
## Find the Missing Number
> You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.

## How to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable?
> Given two variables, x and y, swap two variables without using a third variable.

## A Memory Efficient Doubly Linked List
> An ordinary Doubly Linked List requires space for two address fields to store the addresses of previous and next nodes. A memory efficient version of Doubly Linked List can be created using only one space for address field with every node. This memory efficient Doubly Linked List is called XOR Linked List or Memory Efficient as the list uses bitwise XOR operation to save space for one address. In the XOR linked list, instead of storing actual memory addresses, every node stores the XOR of addresses of previous and next nodes.

## Find the two non-repeating elements.  
> Given an array in which all numbers except two are repeated once. (i.e. we have 2n+2 numbers and n numbers are occurring twice and remaining two have occurred once). Find those two numbers in the most efficient way.

## Find the two numbers with odd occurrences in an unsorted array
> Given an unsorted array that contains even number of occurrences for all numbers except two numbers. Find the two numbers which have odd occurrences in O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space.

## Add two numbers without using arithmetic operators
> Write a function Add() that returns sum of two integers. The function should not use any of the arithmetic operators (+, ++, –, -, .. etc).
 
## Swap bits in a given number
> Given a number x and two positions (from the right side) in the binary representation of x, write a function that swaps n bits at given two positions and returns the result. It is also given that the two sets of bits do not overlap.

## Count number of bits to be flipped to convert A to B
> Given two numbers ‘a’ and b’. Write a program to count number of bits needed to be flipped to convert ‘a’ to ‘b’.

## Find the element that appears once
> Given an array where every element occurs three times, except one element which occurs only once. Find the element that occurs once. Expected time complexity is O(n) and O(1) extra space.

## Detect if two integers have opposite signs
> Given two signed integers, write a function that returns true if the signs of given integers are different, otherwise false. For example, the function should return true -1 and +100, and should return false for -100 and -200. The function should not use any of the arithmetic operators.
